// Prove the following distribution law for map over concatenation
// For any lists xs , ys, function f:
//      (xs ++ ys) map f = (xs map f) ++ (ys map f)
//
// You will need the classes of ++ as well as the following clauses for map
//
//      Nil map f = Nil
//  (x :: xs) map f = f(x) :: (xs map f)
